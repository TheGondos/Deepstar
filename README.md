# Deepstar
Deepstar represents a vision of planetary exploration for Orbiter 2016 with a near-tech aesthetic.

## Installation
Go to releases and download the latest release. Unzip the file directly into the Orbiter folder.

## Build
Download the source into a folder in Orbitersdk, then retarget the solution to your Windows SDK and build normally. The compiled DLLs will be in Modules/Plugin/Deepstar folder.

Open CreateLinks.bat file with a text editor and change ORBITER_FOLDER and VESSEL_FOLDER accordingly, then run the file to create symbolic links for the vessel files in main Orbiter folder.
